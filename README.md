# Deep Learning Projects
This repository collects the assignments completed during the attendance of the Introduction Deep Learning course offered by the Technical University of Munich during the WinterSemester 2021-2022 and held by Dr. Ahn, Hyemin. For both assignments, the baseline codes -as well as training and test datasets- have been provided by dr. Ahn.

## Assignment 1 - Pokémon Classification
The first assignment consisted into classifying pokémon pictures into ten specific classes, according to physical charcteristics like color or body shape. To do that, I employed a pre-trained [50-Layer ResNet](https://pytorch.org/hub/nvidia_deeplearningexamples_resnet50/) which yielded a final test accuracy of 81.6%.

## Assignment 2 - Classification of Celebrities' Tweets using NLP
The second assignment consisted in testing different NLP Models (such as LSTM, RNN, GRU) to correctly classify the tweets of 8 celebrities. More information and a more detailed description of the process can be found in the attached [report]().
